# Etch-a-Sketch

## Overview
This project recreates an Etch-a-Sketch experience in the browser. Users can dynamically draw on a grid by hovering over squares, which change color on interaction. The grid size can also be customized using a reset button, allowing for a personalized drawing area.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: The grid is generated using JavaScript and can be adjusted to a user-specified size.
- **Hover Interaction**: Squares change color when hovered over, mimicking the effect of drawing.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Users can enter a grid size (up to 100x100) via a button.
- **Randomized Colors**: Each hover interaction generates a new random color for the square.
- **Progressive Darkening**: Squares darken progressively with each hover until they become fully black.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Flexbox layout for the grid and styling for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic grid generation, hover effects, and user input handling.
